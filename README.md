# ShoppingList

Exercise 9:

Someone in your house asks you to go to the store.

a) If there are eggs there, you should buy ten.
b) If there is butter, you should buy two bars.
c) If there are both eggs and butter, you should buy four of each instead.
d) If they are selling pies, you should forget about the eggs and butter and bring two pies.

Write a program where you can enter these different possibilities. In the end, you should print the amount of eggs, butter and pies that have been bought. Try to reach all different possibilities to make sure it's working properly.

Hint: boolean values might be of use.
